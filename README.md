### Quick Start Guide

XStream has two modes for different creative workflows:

**Looper Mode** - Traditional Granular Synthesis
- Load an audio sample or record live input
- Adjust grain size, density, and playback position
- Perfect for creating evolving textures, pads, and drones
- Use the position controls to scrub through your sample

**PolySynth Mode** - Polyphonic Granular Synthesis
- Play your samples chromatically across a MIDI keyboard
- Each key triggers independent granular voices
- Create playable granular instruments
- Full velocity sensitivity and polyphonic support

### Basic Workflow

1. **Load a Sample**: Drag and drop an audio file or use the file browser
2. **Choose Your Mode**: Toggle between Looper Mode and PolySynth Mode
3. **Adjust Grain Parameters**:
   - Grain Size: Controls the length of each grain
   - Grain Density: How many grains play simultaneously
   - Position: Where in the sample grains are captured from
4. **Shape the Sound**:
   - Use the envelope controls to shape grain attack/release
   - Adjust pitch and time independently
5. **Add Effects**: Apply built-in effects for further sound design
